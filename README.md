Project to apply pagination concepts

# Search functionality
To do content search, the app is using the OMDb Api (https://www.omdbapi.com/).
It is necessary to add an authorized api key to the queries.
Once you get yours, in the config folder, duplicate the omdb-example.json file and rename it to omdb.json; add your api key in that file
